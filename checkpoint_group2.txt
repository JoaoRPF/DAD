Group 2 Taguspark

- To start the project you should launch two projects: PuppetMaster and PCS, by clicking the Start Button in VS.
- Then, there are two main text boxes. The first one is to write the config file (you should write name.config) and 
then hit "Execute File" or "Step", depending on the type of executing that you want.
- If you want, after launching the project with the config file you can manually introduce commands on the second text box.
- There are multiple config files in the PuppetMaster/bin/Debug folder, that we used across our experiments.
- If you close all the operator windows previously opened, then you can click "Reset" and the PuppetMaster is ready to receive
another config file, without having to restart it via VS.
- We think that all checkpoint features are implemented.
